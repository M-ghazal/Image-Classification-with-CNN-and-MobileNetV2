# Image-Classification-with-CNN-and-MobileNetV2
This project implements image classification using two different approaches:  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras.  Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2, a pre-trained deep learning model, for improved performance.  Additionally, Google Cloud Vision API is used for image analysis and label detection.
